  <h2> Why This Movie Is My Favorite! </h2>
  <p> <i> Weathering With You </i> is one of my favorite anime movie because I got invested in the plot. I also like how the director, Makoto Shinkai, uses elements of romance in the movie. The movie can be easily followed while watching and you can relate deeply to its characters. My favorite character in the film is Hodaka because of his development throughout the film when he met Hina. Even though this is a Shinkai film, the director's <b> creativity </b> in the supernatural elements of the movie is unique compared to his other movies. </p>
